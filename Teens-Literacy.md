# 12-18:
## Saving and Moderating Consumption:
Saving money is important because it allows you to have a financial safety net for unexpected expenses and emergencies, and it also helps you achieve your long-term goals, such as buying a car or paying for college. Moderating consumption based on necessities and luxuries is important because it helps you prioritize spending on the things that are truly important to you, rather than wasting money on things that you don't really need.
For example, necessities like food, clothing, and housing are things that you need to survive and maintain a basic standard of living. Luxuries, on the other hand, are things that you want but don't necessarily need, such as designer clothing or expensive gadgets.
By learning to distinguish between necessities and luxuries, you can make more informed decisions about how to spend your money, and you'll be able to save more money in the long run. It's also important to understand that it's not only about earning money but also being able to use it efficiently.
For example, you could save money by cooking your own meals instead of eating out all the time, or you could save money by buying clothes on sale instead of buying designer clothes at full price.
By developing good money habits and learning to save and budget your money, you'll be able to achieve your financial goals more easily and be more financially stable in the future.

## Loans:
A loan in simple terms is borrowing money from a bank that you have to pay back eventually with interest. The amount of money you can borrow and the interest rate you are charged depends on the institution, as well as your credit score. There are different types of loans such as school loans, car loans, house loans, etc.

If there are some terms that are unfamiliar, don’t worry! We’ll explain them in the upcoming slides.

## Credit Score:
Once you are 18, you can start to build your credit score! Credit score is like a report card for your finances. Just like how you get grades in school for your performance in different subjects, your credit score is a grade that shows how well you handle your money and pay your bills.
A good credit score is like getting an A+ on your report card - it shows that you're responsible and good at managing your money. A bad credit score is like getting a D on your report card - it shows that you're not doing as well financially and you might have trouble getting approved for loans or credit cards.
Just like how you can improve your grades by studying and working hard, you can improve your credit score by paying your bills on time and managing your debt responsibly.
Here's a fun way to think about it: If your credit score is like a report card, then your credit report is like a transcript. It's a detailed record of all your financial grades, including how much debt you have, how often you pay your bills on time, and how much credit you have available.
You can also keep track of your credit score over time and set a goal to improve it by a certain amount each month or year.
It's important to start building a good credit score early, so you can enjoy the benefits of having good credit when you're older, like getting approved for a loan to buy a house or a car. By understanding the importance of credit and taking steps to improve it, you'll be setting yourself up for financial success in the future.

## Interest rates & inflation:
Interest rates and inflation are two important concepts that can affect your finances, and it's important to understand them in order to make informed decisions about your money.
Interest rates refer to the amount of money that a lender charges for borrowing money. For example, if you take out a loan from a bank, the bank will charge you interest on the amount you borrowed. The interest rate can be expressed as a percentage, such as 3% or 5%. The higher the interest rate, the more you'll have to pay back in total.
Inflation is the increase in the prices of goods and a decrease in the purchasing power of our money pre-inflation. For example, let's say a movie ticket cost $10 last year and now it cost $12. This means that the cost of the movie ticket has increased by 20% due to inflation. This means that the money you have today will be worth less in the future because things will cost more.
This is why interest rates and inflation are related because they both affect how much money you'll have to pay in the future. Banks and other institutions that can give out loans will charge interest based on how good your credit score is.
Just like how you have to budget your money for things you want, you also have to budget for interest rates and inflation when it comes to your long-term financial plans. It's important to keep in mind these concepts when making decisions about spending, saving, and investing your money.

## Short-term vs. Long-term purchase goals:
Short-term goals and long-term goals refer to the time frame in which you plan to achieve something.
Short-term goals are things that you want to accomplish in the near future, like buying a new video game or going on a vacation. These goals usually take less than a year to achieve and often require less money and planning.
Long-term goals are things that you want to achieve in the distant future, such as buying a house or saving for retirement. These goals usually take more than a year to achieve and often require more money and planning.
A good way to explain it to teens is to use the example of buying a car. A short-term goal could be buying a used car with cash this year, while a long-term goal could be buying a new car with a car loan in a few years.
It's important to understand that short-term goals are important because they can bring immediate satisfaction and are often easier to achieve. But long-term goals are also important because they can help them achieve bigger and more important things in the future.
You should try to balance both short-term and long-term goals when it comes to your finances. You should have some short-term goals that you're working towards so that you can see progress and have something to look forward to. But you should also have long-term goals that you're saving for so that you can achieve the things that are important to you in the future.
By setting short-term and long-term purchase goals, you’ll learn to use your money wisely and to plan for the future. You’ll also learn the importance of making trade-offs and the benefit of waiting for something they really want instead of buying it impulsively.

## Scam Protection:
Being safe against scams is important for everyone, especially for teens who may not have as much experience with the online world. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:
Be skeptical of unsolicited offers: Scammers often try to trick you into giving them money or personal information by making fake offers that sound too good to be true. If someone contacts you out of the blue and offers you a prize or a deal, be careful and do some research before giving them any information.
Don't click on links from unknown sources: Scammers often use links to spread malware or steal personal information. If you get an email or a message from someone you don't know, don't click on any links or download any attachments.
Don't give out personal information: Scammers may ask you for personal information such as your social security number, bank account information, or credit card number. Never give out this information to anyone you don't know.
Be careful on social media: Scammers can use social media to steal personal information, spread malware, or trick you into giving them money. Be careful about what you post and who you interact with online.
If you're not sure, ask an adult: If you're not sure whether something is a scam or not, ask a trusted adult for help.
Imagine that you and your friends are playing a game, and one of the players is pretending to be someone else to cheat and steal from other players. That's what a scammer does, they pretend to be someone else to steal from you. Just like how you would be careful and not give away personal information to that player, you should be careful and not give away personal information to someone online.
It's also important to remember that Scammers may use different ways to reach you, such as phone calls, text message or social media, so be aware of any unsolicited contact. And if something feels off, trust your gut and don't engage with it.
The golden rule of being safe from scams is: “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”
