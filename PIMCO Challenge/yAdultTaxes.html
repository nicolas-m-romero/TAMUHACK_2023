<p>There are several types of taxes that are applied in the United States, including:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 1%;">
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Income tax: This is a tax on an individual's or business's income. This tax is collected by the federal government through the IRS and is based on an individual's or business's income level and filing status. For example, a person who earns $50,000 per year and is single will pay a different income tax rate than a person who earns the same amount but is married.</li><br>
    <li>Sales tax: This is a tax on the sale of goods and services. Sales tax is collected by state and local governments and is typically added to the purchase price of goods and services at the time of sale. For example, if an individual purchases a $100 item and the sales tax rate is 7%, they will pay $107 for the item, with $7 being the sales tax.</li><br>
    <li>Property tax: This is a tax on the value of real estate or personal property. Property tax is collected by state and local governments and is based on the assessed value of the property. For example, if an individual owns a house valued at $200,000 and the property tax rate is 1%, they will pay $2,000 in property taxes per year.</li><br>
    <li>Excise tax: This is a tax on specific goods or services, such as gasoline, cigarettes, or alcohol. Excise tax is collected by the federal government and is usually included in the purchase price of the item. For example, if an individual buys a pack of cigarettes for $6 and the excise tax on cigarettes is $1.50 per pack, the total cost of the cigarettes will be $7.50.</li><br>
    <li>Payroll tax: This is a tax on wages and salaries that is collected by the federal government to fund Social Security and Medicare. Employers and employees each pay a portion of the payroll tax, with the employer paying 6.2% and the employee paying 6.2% for Social Security, and 1.45% for Medicare for each. For example, if an employee earns $50,000 a year, they will pay $3,100 in payroll taxes.</li><br>
    <br>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>All of these taxes play an important role in funding government programs and services, and are collected through a variety of methods, including withholding from paychecks, quarterly estimated payments, and annual filings.</p>
<p>If there are some terms that are unfamiliar, don’t worry! We’ll explain them in the upcoming slides.</p>
