<p>A mortgage is a loan that is used to purchase a home. There are several important pieces of information to know about mortgages:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 1%;">
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Down Payment: A down payment is the amount of money that the borrower must pay upfront in order to purchase a home. Typically, the down payment is a percentage of the home's purchase price. The larger the down payment, the smaller the loan amount and the less interest the borrower will pay over the life of the loan.</li><br>
    <li>Interest Rate: The interest rate is the amount of interest that the borrower must pay on the loan. Interest rates can vary depending on the type of loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and the current market conditions.</li><br>
    <li>Loan Term: The loan term is the length of time that the borrower has to repay the loan. Mortgage loan terms typically range from 15 to 30 years.</li><br>
    <li>Closing Costs: Closing costs are the fees that are associated with the purchase of a home. These costs can include appraisal fees, title search fees, and lender fees, among others.</li><br>
    <li>Escrow: Escrow is an account that is set up to hold funds for the purpose of paying property taxes and insurance. The mortgage lender will typically collect a set amount of money each month from the borrower to be held in escrow.</li><br>
    <li>Property Taxes and Insurance: Property taxes and insurance are ongoing expenses that the borrower must pay as a homeowner. These expenses are typically included in the mortgage payment and are paid out of the escrow account.</li><br>
    <li>Prepayment Penalties: Some mortgages have prepayment penalties, which are fees that are assessed if the borrower pays off the mortgage before the loan term is up.</li><br>
    <li>PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance): PMI is a type of insurance that is required for borrowers who put less than 20% down on a home. PMI is typically added to the borrower's monthly mortgage payment and can be cancelled if the borrower reaches a certain level of equity in the home.</li><br>
    <br>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>It is important to shop around for the best mortgage rates and terms, and to compare the costs of different mortgages. It is also important to make sure that you can afford the monthly mortgage payments, including property taxes and insurance, and to consider the long-term costs of the loan.<br></p>
<p>If there are some terms that are unfamiliar, don’t worry! We’ll explain them in the upcoming slides.</p>
