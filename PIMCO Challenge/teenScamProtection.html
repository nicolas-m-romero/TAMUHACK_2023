<p>Being safe against scams is important for everyone, especially for teens who may not have as much experience with the online world. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:
Be skeptical of unsolicited offers: Scammers often try to trick you into giving them money or personal information by making fake offers that sound too good to be true. If someone contacts you out of the blue and offers you a prize or a deal, be careful and do some research before giving them any information.
Don&#39;t click on links from unknown sources: Scammers often use links to spread malware or steal personal information. If you get an email or a message from someone you don&#39;t know, don&#39;t click on any links or download any attachments.
Don&#39;t give out personal information: Scammers may ask you for personal information such as your social security number, bank account information, or credit card number. Never give out this information to anyone you don&#39;t know.
Be careful on social media: Scammers can use social media to steal personal information, spread malware, or trick you into giving them money. Be careful about what you post and who you interact with online.
If you&#39;re not sure, ask an adult: If you&#39;re not sure whether something is a scam or not, ask a trusted adult for help.
Imagine that you and your friends are playing a game, and one of the players is pretending to be someone else to cheat and steal from other players. That&#39;s what a scammer does, they pretend to be someone else to steal from you. Just like how you would be careful and not give away personal information to that player, you should be careful and not give away personal information to someone online.
It&#39;s also important to remember that Scammers may use different ways to reach you, such as phone calls, text message or social media, so be aware of any unsolicited contact. And if something feels off, trust your gut and don&#39;t engage with it.
The golden rule of being safe from scams is: “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”</p>
