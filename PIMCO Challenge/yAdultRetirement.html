<p>Planning for retirement is important because it allows individuals to ensure that they have enough money to support themselves during their golden years. Without proper planning, individuals may find themselves struggling financially in retirement, which can lead to a decrease in their standard of living or even poverty.<br><br>There are several types of retirement plans that individuals can use to save for their golden years. Some of the most common include:</p>
<p style="padding-top: 1%;">
    <ol type="1">
    <li>401(k) plans: 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored retirement plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a pre-tax basis. Employers may also choose to match a percentage of an employee's contributions, which can increase the amount of money an employee is able to save.</li><br>
    <li>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): IRAs are personal savings plans that are designed for retirement. There are two types of IRAs: Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars.</li><br>
    <li>Pension plans: Pension plans are retirement plans sponsored by employers. They provide a guaranteed stream of income to retirees, usually based on their years of service and salary at retirement.</li><br>
    <li>Annuities: An annuity is a financial product that pays out a stream of payments to an individual, typically used as a retirement income. They can be fixed or variable and can be purchased through an insurance company.</li><br>
    <li>Social Security: Social Security is a government-run retirement program that provides a guaranteed stream of income to eligible individuals. Social Security benefits are based on an individual's earnings history and are paid out starting at age 62.</li><br>
    <br>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>Each type of retirement plan has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the best plan for an individual will depend on their personal circumstances and goals. It's important to research the different options and consult with a financial advisor to determine the best plan for you.</p>
