<h2 id="saving-and-moderating-consumption-">Saving and Moderating Consumption:</h2>
<p>Saving money is important because it allows you to have a financial safety net for unexpected expenses and emergencies, and it also helps you achieve your long-term goals, such as buying a car or paying for college. Moderating consumption based on necessities and luxuries is important because it helps you prioritize spending on the things that are truly important to you, rather than wasting money on things that you don&#39;t really need.
For example, necessities like food, clothing, and housing are things that you need to survive and maintain a basic standard of living. Luxuries, on the other hand, are things that you want but don&#39;t necessarily need, such as designer clothing or expensive gadgets.
By learning to distinguish between necessities and luxuries, you can make more informed decisions about how to spend your money, and you&#39;ll be able to save more money in the long run. It&#39;s also important to understand that it&#39;s not only about earning money but also being able to use it efficiently.
For example, you could save money by cooking your own meals instead of eating out all the time, or you could save money by buying clothes on sale instead of buying designer clothes at full price.
By developing good money habits and learning to save and budget your money, you&#39;ll be able to achieve your financial goals more easily and be more financially stable in the future.</p>
<h2 id="loans-">Loans:</h2>
<p>A loan in simple terms is borrowing money from a bank that you have to pay back eventually with interest. The amount of money you can borrow and the interest rate you are charged depends on the institution, as well as your credit score. There are different types of loans such as school loans, car loans, house loans, etc.</p>
<p>If there are some terms that are unfamiliar, don’t worry! We’ll explain them in the upcoming slides.</p>
