<h2 id="short-term-vs-long-term-purchase-goals-">Short-term vs. Long-term purchase goals:</h2>
<p>Short-term goals and long-term goals refer to the time frame in which you plan to achieve something.
Short-term goals are things that you want to accomplish in the near future, like buying a new video game or going on a vacation. These goals usually take less than a year to achieve and often require less money and planning.
Long-term goals are things that you want to achieve in the distant future, such as buying a house or saving for retirement. These goals usually take more than a year to achieve and often require more money and planning.
A good way to explain it to teens is to use the example of buying a car. A short-term goal could be buying a used car with cash this year, while a long-term goal could be buying a new car with a car loan in a few years.
It&#39;s important to understand that short-term goals are important because they can bring immediate satisfaction and are often easier to achieve. But long-term goals are also important because they can help them achieve bigger and more important things in the future.
You should try to balance both short-term and long-term goals when it comes to your finances. You should have some short-term goals that you&#39;re working towards so that you can see progress and have something to look forward to. But you should also have long-term goals that you&#39;re saving for so that you can achieve the things that are important to you in the future.
By setting short-term and long-term purchase goals, you’ll learn to use your money wisely and to plan for the future. You’ll also learn the importance of making trade-offs and the benefit of waiting for something they really want instead of buying it impulsively.</p>
